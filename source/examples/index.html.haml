    %p This is Stagehand at its simplest. You don't need to name your stages and scenes â€“ Stagehand detects sibling elements without a stage name as being part of the same stage.
  - when 2
    %p You can name scenes and stages if you like. Unnamed scenes/stages will be named (uncreatively) by Stagehand.
  - when 3
    %p Oftentimes you'll want to toggle a class or ID rather than just visibility of an element. Piece of cake:

    :markdown
      You can assign multiple stages and scenes to actors (separated by commas), and you can nest scenes and stages to your heart's content; hey, whether the resulting states make any sense is up to you.

      There are two special keywords in Stagehand: `all` and `toggle`.

      If an actor has a scene of `all`, it's visible for all scenes of a stage, and that stage is also given a scene option of 'none' in the toolbar (which toggles every associated actor off),

      Sometimes, instead of switching between actors, you might want to toggle a single actor (or group of actors). If an actor has a scene of `toggle`, its stage is given two scenes, 'toggle on' and 'toggle off'.
